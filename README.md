# Future-Ready
Deployed a payment gateway integrated website on Azure Services. There is a donation button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc. Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount. My website name is Sahayak Foundation and it's for the donation for the help of needy people, trees, against pollution, etc. 
i have Azure Storage, Azure Blob, Azure Static website, azure bot service, Azure Cost Management and Billing and Visual Studio Code. I have hosted it on Microsoft Azure and made it from scratch. I have added a donate button and added donate option from RAZORPAY. i have used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
